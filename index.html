                                    most solid financial assets, stocks behave different than other assets such as Commodities, Bonds,

                            <p class = "content">Every human, who values their future, always looks for investment opportunities that 
                                can increase their current income, provide financial security and build towards a solid retirement plan. 
                                Securing a better financial future might lead us to venture into unknown terrain, like the financial 
                                markets. Most people are apprehensive, as financial markets often feel complex and cumbersome. How can 
                                someone succeed in these markets?</br>
                            </br>
                                Well the answer is very simple. In the past 20 years, investing has moved out of the darkness and into 
                                the limelight. No longer are opportunities available to selected few investors, like Warren Buffet and 
                                Peter Lynch.</br>
                        </br>
                                Today, if you’re not investing, you are considered to be keeping your money idle. That is, your money is 
                                not “working” for you; and by working… we mean its not earning you more money! Investing and 
                                understanding the markets has now become simple and widespread. There are tons of tutorials available, 
                                simple to use software and a bunch-load of great investment tips. All readily available to assist you in 
                                growing your wealth.

                                    <p>This is a subjective question. Earning from stocks can relate to both your entry time and 
                                        position. As an example, in 2020, Amazon Inc Stocks increased their value from $1,771 per 
                                        share to over $3,000. That translates to a yearly growth of over 77% which was the potential 
                                        profit one could have gained that year.

                                <p>Opening an account, verifying it and purchasing your first assets, takes about 5 minutes. 
                                    But having said that, there is always more than just making a registration, depositing funds and 
                                    buying a stock. It is advisable that you also budget some time for learning the ins and outs of
