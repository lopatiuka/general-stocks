                                For over 400 years stocks have been a part of our life. It is recognized as one of the most solid 
                                financial assets and this is since stocks behave different rather than other financial assets, 
                                such as Commodities, Bonds, etc…</br>
                            </br>
                                It is a fact that we are all… you, me, our parents (well even our grandparents) been looking for 
                                an investment venture to either make ends meet or maybe to start a retirement fund, thus aiming at 
                                a better financial future, this leads us to venture in to the unknown terrain of the financial 
                                markets… And lets be honest, what do we really know about the financial markets and investments?
                            </p>
                            <p class = "intro-paragraph">Well the answer is very simple. In the past 20 years or so, we’ve moved 
                                from being in the darkness when it comes to investments and evolved to a stage where if you are 
                                not investing you are considered to be wasting your money! Which in somewhat is true, since our 
                                invested funds creates more value which will be translated to what we call “Nominal Value”, real 
                                value, aka cash money in our bank accounts.”</br>
                            </br>
                                The question is not if we should invest or not, the question is - How to invest & in what to 
                                invest…. The answer is simple, but at the same time the reality of today creates a “simple complex” 
                                for us retailers, and to find the solution one needs to keep specific rules to kick of his own 
                                journey as an “investor”.

                                    purchase your assets takes about 5 minutes. But having said that, there is always more than just making a registration, depositing funds and buying a stock.
